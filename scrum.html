                <p data-key="scrumS1P1">Scrum is a framework that helps people, teams, and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It is deliberately incomplete, only defining the parts required to implement Scrum theory. Scrum is built upon by the collective intelligence of the people using it.</p>
