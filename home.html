                <p data-key="section1P1">Agile is far more than a set of processes; it is a <strong>mindset</strong>. It's a fundamental shift in how we approach our work. It's about viewing challenges and projects through a lens of adaptability, collaboration, and continuous improvement.</p>
                
                <h3 data-key="section1H3_1">Fixed Mindset vs. Agile Mindset</h3>
                <p data-key="section1P2">A traditional <strong>Fixed Mindset</strong> (like in Waterfall projects) views failure as a final. Plans are rigid, roles are siloed, and change is seen as a problem.</p>
                <p data-key="section1P3">An <strong>Agile Mindset</strong> embraces change as a competitive advantage. It sees failure as a learning opportunity. It prizes collaboration, trusts teams to self-organize, and focuses relentlessly on delivering <em>value</em> to the customer, not just completing a task list.</p>
                
                <h3 data-key="section1H3_2">The Two Sides of Agile</h3>
                <p data-key="section1P4"><strong>1. The "Being Agile" (Mindset):</strong> This is the 'why'. It's our culture, values, and principles. It's about respect, courage, and collaboration.</p>
                <p data-key="section1P5"><strong>2. The "Doing Agile" (Practices):</strong> This is the 'how'. It's the frameworks (like Scrum, Kanban), the events (like Daily Scrums, Retrospectives), and the practices that bring the mindset to life.</p>

                <p data-key="section2P1">The Agile Manifesto is built on four core values. The wording is specific: "we value the items on the left <em>more</em>," which doesn't mean the items on the right have no value.</p>

                    <li data-key="principle1">Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle2">Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle3">Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle4">Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle5">Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle6">The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle7">Working software is the primary measure of progress.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle8">Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle9">Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle10">Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle11">The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.</li>
                    <li data-key="principle12">At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.</li>
